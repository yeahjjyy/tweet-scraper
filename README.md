# tweet-scraper

## Description

Social media platforms like Twitter are treasure troves of valuable data. This project leverages Python with Selenium to automate data scraping from Twitter. By monitoring the browser's network activity, we can capture the necessary requests and responses, making the scraping process more efficient. 

Furthermore, using [twitter-advanced-search](https://github.com/igorbrigadir/twitter-advanced-search) capabilities allows us to filter and target specific tweets, enabling precise data collection based on keywords, dates, hashtags, and more. This approach provides a powerful tool for researchers, marketers, and developers to gather insights from Twitter data.
